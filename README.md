# automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python
Repo to hold the little programs I'm making as I go through the wonderful [Automate The Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), by Al Sweigart. Really recommend it as an intro to Python, too. 

The program's names are the same as in the book.
Keep in mind this is a beginner's book, but it does get interesting fast :)
